# ðŸŽ¯ Understanding Your Digital Dependencies

Before beginning your de-corporatization journey, you need to assess your current digital ecosystem. Most people rely on integrated corporate services from Google, Apple, Microsoft, Meta, and Amazon that create data silos and privacy vulnerabilities.

This guide provides privacy-focused alternatives for each major category, with clear migration paths that won't leave you stranded. The key to successful digital independence is **gradual migration** - implementing changes systematically while bringing your network with you.

## âš¡ What You'll Gain vs. Trade-offs

### Privacy Gains
- Dramatic reduction in corporate surveillance
- Enhanced control over personal information
- Improved security against data breaches
- Freedom from algorithmic manipulation
- Reduced dependency on big tech ecosystems

### Realistic Trade-offs
- Initial setup time (20-40 hours over 3-4 months)

- Learning curve for new interfaces
- Modest cost increase ($200-500/year for premium services)
- Occasional compatibility issues requiring workarounds

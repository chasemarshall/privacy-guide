# Privacy Guide

This project hosts the "Complete Digital Privacy Guide" in Markdown format. The documentation lives in the `docs/` directory and is rendered as a static site through `index.html`. Each section of the guide resides in its own Markdown file, and the front-end uses [marked](https://marked.js.org/) to convert the files to HTML.

## Development

Open `index.html` in a browser to browse the guide. Edit the Markdown files in `docs/` to update the content.
